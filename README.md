**Retail Superstore Performance Analytics | Power BI Case Study**

**Business Intelligence | Profitability Analysis**

**Project Overview**

Retail leaders often have access to large volumes of data but lack decision-ready insights. This project demonstrates how raw retail transaction data was transformed into an executive Power BI dashboard that supports profitability, demand planning, and customer strategy decisions.

**Business Problems Solved and Impact**

Enabled Executive Visibility into Business Performance
Leadership lacked a single, trusted view of sales, profit, and customer value.

**Solution:**
Built an interactive KPI dashboard consolidating revenue, profit, orders, and customer metrics into one source of truth.

**Impact:**

Faster executive decision-making

Clear, consistent performance monitoring

Improved Demand Planning Through Seasonality Insights
Unclear demand patterns increased the risk of stockouts during peak periods and excess inventory during low-demand months.

**Solution:**
Analyzed sales and profit trends over time, revealing strong seasonality with peak demand in Q4 (November–December).

**Impact:**

Proactive inventory and staffing planning

Reduced operational risk during high-demand periods

Optimized Customer Strategy Using Profit-Based Segmentation
**Marketing efforts were not aligned to actual profit contribution across customer segments.**

**Solution:**
Segmented customers by profit contribution rather than revenue alone:

Consumer: $134K profit

Corporate: $92K profit

Home Office: $60K profit

Impact:

Focused growth strategies on the highest-return segments

Improved marketing ROI and customer targeting

Identified Hidden Margin Leakage at Product Level
**High sales volume masked loss-making products, eroding profitability.**

**Solution:**
Conducted product and sub-category margin analysis:

High-margin categories (Labels, Paper) up to 44.42%

Negative-margin products as low as –8.56%

**Impact:**

Enabled corrective pricing and sourcing decisions

Protected profit without chasing additional revenue

Strengthened Pricing and Discount Governance
**Discounting activity lacked visibility, risking unnecessary margin erosion.**

**Solution:**
Analyzed discount behavior across product categories, confirming tightly controlled discount rates below 0.0010.

**Impact:**

Validated pricing discipline

Identified opportunities for targeted promotional testing

Identified Revenue-Driving Products
**Top-performing SKUs were not clearly defined for scaling and promotion.**

**Solution:**
Ranked products by sales performance, identifying the Canon Image Series as the top seller at $61.6K.

**Impact:**

Informed inventory prioritization and upsell strategies

Supported supplier and marketing alignment
